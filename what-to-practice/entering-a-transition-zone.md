  Regardless of the transition type, approaching a transition zone has a handful
  of common actions.

# Entering a transition zone

By the time you stop in a transition zone, you should be ready to act. Do not wait until you enter the transition zone to get organized. The more you can do beforehand, the faster the transition will be.

As you approach the transition zone:

<details>

<summary>Choose your position, and move toward it.</summary>

You want to be as forward in the transition zone as possible. This will allow for a fast exit and minimizes the chances of traffic in the zone interfering (kicking your poles, blocking your exit, etc.)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Put both poles in one hand, and offset the pole grips.</summary>

1. Extend your arms ahead of you so the poles are vertical;
2. With one hand, grab both poles below the opposite grip.
3. Remove the opposite hand from its wrist loop, and grab both poles below the first hand.
4. Remove the first hand from its wrist loop.

Offsetting the pole grips will make for less fussing around when you try to get your hands back in your wrist loops.

<details>

<summary>Unzip your suit as you place your poles on the ground.</summary>

1. With your first hand, grab the zipper on your suit, and bite the collar.\
   \
   At this point, your poles are still in your second hand. You need to bite your collar to resist the zipper movement.
2. As you bend over, unzip your suit and place your poles on the ground parallel to your skis.\
   \
   Some racers prefer to place their poles between their legs to minimize the chance of them getting kicked. This may be an issue in Europe, but North American races are so sparsely attended, I've never found it necessary.

**Exception:** [Skin to Boot](skin-to-boot.md) and [Boot to Skin](boot-to-skin.md) don't require you to unzip your suit. In the former, your skins stay on your skis. In the latter, they're already in place.
