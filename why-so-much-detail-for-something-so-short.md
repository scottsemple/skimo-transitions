# Why so much detail for something so short?

Skimo transitions are an essential skill in skimo racing. Done well, the time they take is insignificant when compared to the length of a typical skimo race. **Done badly, transitions can add minutes to your race time and force you to finish well behind other racers of similar fitness.** That sucks.

_But anyone can have fast transitions._ All it takes is practice.
