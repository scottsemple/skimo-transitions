# Why they matter

At the top and bottom of each leg of a skimo race, racers have to adjust their equipment. The adjustments are called transitions because the changes allow racers to change between skinning, skiing, and bootpacking.

Mastering each combination is essential in order to make transitions an almost-irrelevant part of a race. If you screw them up, they add annuecessary time to your race. Your race result will haunt you with what could have been if you had practiced.

This is especially true in the sprint format. A skimo sprint course takes between four and six minutes to complete. In such a short race, a botched transition can be the difference between a decent result and the back pf the pack.
